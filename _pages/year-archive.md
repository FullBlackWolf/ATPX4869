This tool is a further refinement and development of lineage tracing. Lineage tracing refers to reconstructing cellular dynamics during the clonal process by inserting DNA base sequences. Step 1-3: Capture cell samples and insert fragments using DOX technology. Step 4-6: When the cells begin to clone, these fragments are carried along. As the cells differentiate, these fragments are also retained but may acquire some random mutations. This technology enables us to trace and observe cells. However, it is extremely expensive and has a very low success rate in DNA insert and detect. Therefore, using RNA sequencing for cell tracking has become a popular topic.

该工具是谱系追踪技术的进一步改进和发展。谱系追踪是通过插入DNA碱基序列来重建克隆过程中细胞的动态。步骤1-3：获取细胞样本并使用DOX技术插入片段。步骤4-6：当细胞开始克隆时，这些片段被携带并传递。随着细胞分化，这些片段也会被保留，但可能会出现一些随机突变。此技术使我们能够追踪并观察细胞。然而，这种方法成本极高，且DNA插入和检测的成功率非常低。因此，利用RNA测序进行细胞追踪已成为一个热门研究话题。

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
