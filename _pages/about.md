These documents were written by Junpeng Chen and Junyao Jiang, who are the project leaders. Junpeng Chen designed the machine learning component and the mathematics theory part. Junyao Jiang carried out the single-cell analysis. Kailin Yang, Haihui Wu, and Shanshan Wang conducted the animal experiments. You Li and TIanda Sun solved many key problems related to the project.

<br><div style="text-align: justify;">
Every team member dedicated a lot of effort to this project, especially You Li, Junyao Jiang, and Zhouweiyu Chen. You Li and Zhouweiyu Chen often worked tirelessly from early morning on one day to the next morning, fixing issues in the code. We are grateful for their pursuit of truth and perseverance, and every team member should sincerely thank these two collaborators.

Junyao Jiang guided the work throughout, particularly when facing chaotic project management issues, helping to correct each problem carefully, and rigorously reviewing the reproducibility of the algorithms. This level of precision is undoubtedly a noble contribution to the scientific community.

The biological experiments were primarily conducted by Kailin Yang, with guidance from Junyao Jiang throughout. You Li and Junpeng Chen performed extensive data analysis. You Li handled all the error calculation steps, verified the temporal relationships in cloning, and assisted in testing several hypotheses, such as using RNA transcription to estimate cloning times. You Li also helped Junpeng Chen package, test, and release the entire project. Junpeng Chen designed the algorithms and completed the packaging of the entire project.

Zhouweiyu Chen and Yuwei Li proposed constructive improvements to the algorithms. Without Zhouweiyu Chen’s error calculations and You Li’s numerical calculations, completing this work would have been nearly impossible. Junpeng Chen proposed the computational principles, but this work was initially unstable. Zhouweiyu Chen improved the critical computational steps, and Yuwei Li perfected the work and was deeply involved in all preliminary research.
</div>
<br><div style="text-align: justify;">
We are so hate for Yuwei Li's unsuccessful Ph.D. application. He was an excellent member of us.

Although these authors are not listed as the first authors, they should be regarded as equal contributors to this work. Their contributions are no less significant than those of Junpeng Chen.
